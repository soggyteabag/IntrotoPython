TASK: 
Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list.

Note: Empty arrays should return 0.


def find_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
#as empty arrays must = 0 and we can't see if the list is made up of strings or numbers, we must return anything not a number as 0
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
#to find the average we then take the sum of the list / by the length(len) of the list
    return average
    
    pass
