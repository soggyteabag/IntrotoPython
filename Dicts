# We'll use a dictionary to keep count of the letters we've
# seen. We'll start with an empty dictionary:

letter_counts = {}
# The keys will be the letters, and the values will be the
# number of that letter we've seen.

# We'll use a for loop to iterate over each letter in the
# string:

for letter in text:
  # We'll check if the letter is already in our dictionary
  # of counts. We can do this using the `not in` operator.
  if letter not in letter_counts:
    # If it isn't, we'll add it to the dictionary with a
    # starting count of 1.
    letter_counts[letter] = 1
    # Note that the syntax for assigning a value to a key in
    # a dict is similar to assigning a variable.
  else:
    # If it is, we'll increment the count for that letter.
    letter_counts[letter] = letter_counts[letter] + 1



# Write this function that counts the number of words by
# how many letters they have. For example:

# words:  ["hat", "cat", "I", "bird"]
# result: {3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1}
# Since there are two words of length 3, etc.
