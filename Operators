This is my Introduction to learning Python via Makers intro to Programming series on Replit

Here I will document some of the useful code and lessons I want to remember and come back to as I complete the series. 

Operators 

Arithematic Operators 
+ : Addition (e.g., a + b)
- : Subtraction (e.g., a - b)
* : Multiplication (e.g., a * b)
/ : Division (e.g., a / b)
% : Modulus (returns the remainder) (e.g., a % b)
** : Exponentiation (e.g., a ** b)
// : Floor division (returns the integer part of the division) (e.g., a // b)

For instance 
def add_one(num):
  return num + 1

This will return a number inputed with 1 added to it

Here is another example from a task set by Makers 
def add_numbers(a, b):
  return a + b

This will return the input numbers added together 

Comparison Operators 

== : Equal to (e.g., a == b)
!= : Not equal to (e.g., a != b)
> : Greater than (e.g., a > b)
< : Less than (e.g., a < b)
>= : Greater than or equal to (e.g., a >= b)
<= : Less than or equal to (e.g., a <= b)

Below is a Comparison task given to us: 
using the def code it will return whether or not the following statements were true or not.

def a_is_greater_than_b(a, b):
  return a > b
  pass

check_that_these_are_equal(
  a_is_greater_than_b(1, 2),
  False
)

check_that_these_are_equal(
  a_is_greater_than_b(1, 1),
  False
)

check_that_these_are_equal(
  a_is_greater_than_b(2, 1),
  True
)

Logical Operators 

and : Returns True if both statements are true (e.g., a and b)
or : Returns True if one of the statements is true (e.g., a or b)
not : Reverses the result (returns False if the result is true) (e.g., not a)


and

age = 25
has_id = True

# Check if the person is 18 or older and has an ID
if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You are allowed to enter.")
else:
    print("You are not allowed to enter.")


or

is_raining = False
has_umbrella = True

# Check if it's raining or if the person has an umbrella
if is_raining or has_umbrella:
    print("You can go outside.")
else:
    print("Better stay indoors.")

not

is_tired = False

# Check if the person is not tired
if not is_tired:
    print("You can keep working.")
else:
    print("Take a rest.")


and or not

is_weekend = True
is_holiday = False
has_work = False

# Check if it's the weekend, or it's a holiday, and you don't have work
if (is_weekend or is_holiday) and not has_work:
    print("You can relax today.")
else:
    print("Time to work.")
