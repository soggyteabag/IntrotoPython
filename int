% = taking the remainder of a sum 


x = input("What's x? ")
y = input("What's y? ")

z = int(x) + int(y) 
# if we dont include the int before our strings x and y will just print literally as they are

print(z) 

#we can also print it like this: 

x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

print(x + y) 

float
x = float(input("whats x? "))
# this allows for decimals

round will round it to the nearest digit 

z = round(x +y)
