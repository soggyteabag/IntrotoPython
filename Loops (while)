i = 0 # We call this the counter variable
while i < 10:
  print(f"The number is now {i}")
  i = i + 1

# The `while` loop is like an `if`, in that it takes an
# expression that evaluates to True or False, and then
# executes its block of code if the condition is True.

# However, the `while` loop is different in that it keeps
# repeatedly executing the block for as long as the
# condition is True.

TASK:

# Write a function that adds the item "cats" to the given
# word_list, repeatedly, a number of times defined by the
# given count parameter.
# Example:
#    add_cats_repeatedly([], 3)
# => ['cats', 'cats', 'cats']

Solution:

def add_cats_repeatedly(word_list, count):
  i = 0     #we need to first create the variable
  while i < count:    #we then add the loop function (in this case less than) 
    word_list.append("cats")      #we've created the variables and the loop so now we need to add the item requested "cats" in this case to the list as it was not there before
    i = i + 1       #this is the most important step. without the counting variable for addition we would create an infinite loop and the programme would run forever
  return word_list    #finally we return the list with our edits
